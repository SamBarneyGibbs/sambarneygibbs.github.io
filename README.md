Sam's first repository
## Hi! My name is Sam Barney-Gibbs. Iâ€™ve spent a majority of my life in Southern California, but I was born in New Jersey with my twin sister and raised by two fantastic moms. I like to write across genres, play tennis, cook/bake, and watch an excessive amount of tv. My friends would call me detail-oriented, multifaceted, and compassionate, but I would call myself arguably obssessive, moody, and maybe even a people-pleaser. 
## I will be a junior at Lehigh University (class of 2024). I declared majors in journalism and political science and minors in philosophy and global studies. Currently, I am part of the Eckardt Scholar Honors Program, will be the news editor for The Brown and White newspaper, am a TRAC Fellow, intern for the Office of UN Programs, and am a club tennis team member.
## I hope to use my education and innate drive to be a hell-raising force in the journalistic world to educate, inform, and move the public to make important decisions, feel important emotions, and be better people for the worldly knowledge they obtain.

# Infographic 
![Supreme Court Approval](https://github.com/SamBarneyGibbs/DataVisualization/blob/main/J25Visualization.png?raw=true)
This data comes from the latest Marquette Law School Supreme Court national survey which was conducted July 5-12, 2022. They interviewed 1.003 adults with a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points. The data found polarization between opinons of the Supreme Court between parties and over time. Generally, approval ratings are diminishing over time directly related to recent rulings of the Court. It shows that United States citizens are increasingly divided between political parties and alludes to growing disdain of this aspect of the judicial branch.

This data comes from the American Trends Panel (ATP) Wave 94 survey of mid 2021. They interviewed 11,178 people with a margin of error of +/- 1.4 percentage points. This data provides consumers with knowledge of popular platforms for receiving news information via age which can help to identify demographic shifts based on platform usage. The prevalence of digital media platforms overall is proven in addition to the dying out of traditional print media, among other things. 
# Time-Series Chart
![Anxiety Between Ages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamBarneyGibbs/sambarneygibbs.github.io/main/J25TimeSeriesChart.png)
This data looks at changing levels of high anxiety over almost a decade but differentiates between age groups. This can be helpful to identify the demographics at higher risk of mental health struggles and target their care in addition to providing foundation for trends causing these changes in anxious behavior over time. All groups had similar levels in 2009 but the younger age groups tended to have increased anxiety as time increased. No levels decreased from their 'starting point' in 2009.

The Insurance Information Institute organized data from the National Interagency Fire Center on the states with the most wildfires in 2021 based on acres burned. This map provides the top five states and possible further rationale for these findings. This data can help professionals understand and research hotspots, finding trends to attempt increased precautionary measures for at-risk zones and can help educate civilians in assessing their fire safety and necessary caution. The map shows the west coast of the United States is at higher risk, specifically for areas with mixed desert and forest landscapes.

This data comes from a survey conducted by previous J25 Lehigh students attempting to understand the dynamics of on-campus versus off-campus partying at Lehigh University. This information can help students understand their peers, school's location, and culture fostered for the campus community. It seems students prepare more for on-campus parties (mostly associated with Greek life) and prefer attending off-campus parties.

This data comes from Pew Research Center's CQ Roll Call conducted in 2019. It displays the 116th Congress's reported religious affiliations, helping to understand the direct religious representation of Congress at that time with both general religions and more specific makeups of them. Consumers of this data are able to see which religions control legislative decision-making and can inform future election results.
