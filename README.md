Sam's first repository
## Hi! My name is Sam Barney-Gibbs. Iâ€™ve spent a majority of my life in Southern California, but I was born in New Jersey with my twin sister and raised by two fantastic moms. I like to write across genres, play tennis, cook/bake, and watch an excessive amount of tv. My friends would call me detail-oriented, multifaceted, and compassionate, but I would call myself arguably obssessive, moody, and maybe even a people-pleaser. 
## I will be a junior at Lehigh University (class of 2024). I declared majors in journalism and political science and minors in philosophy and global studies. Currently, I am part of the Eckardt Scholar Honors Program, will be the news editor for The Brown and White newspaper, am a TRAC Fellow, intern for the Office of UN Programs, and am a club tennis team member.
## I hope to use my education and innate drive to be a hell-raising force in the journalistic world to educate, inform, and move the public to make important decisions, feel important emotions, and be better people for the worldly knowledge they obtain.

Supreme Court Approval in July 2022 - Marquette Law School - this data comes from the latest Marquette Law School Supreme Court national survey which was conducted July 5-12, 2022. It interviewed 1.003 adults with a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points. The data found polarization between opinons of the Supreme Court between parties and over time. Generally, approval ratings are diminishing over time directly related to recent rulings of the Court. It shows that United States citizens are increasingly divided between political parties and alludes to growing disdain of this aspect of the judicial branch.
